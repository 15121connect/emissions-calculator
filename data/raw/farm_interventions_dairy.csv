plate_cooler_efficiency_upgrade,plate_cooler,dairy,Efficiency Upgrades and Maintenance,Pre-Cool Milk By Install a Plate Cooler,"""A plate cooler, employed on dairy farms, serves to pre-cool milk before it reaches the bulk tank. Functioning as a heat exchanger, it transfers heat between warm milk and cool well water. This system offers several benefits, including the pre-cooling of milk, leading to a reduction of 40-50% in cooling expenses, minimizing the operating time of refrigeration units and thereby extending their lifespan. Additionally, it accelerates milk cooling, enhancing its quality, while also producing warmed well water suitable for watering or wash-down purposes""",7590,daily_milk_production_inp*num_1.146,kWh
heat_recov_efficiency_upgrade,refrigeration_heat_recovery,dairy,Efficiency Upgrades and Maintenance,Refrigeration Heat Recovery,"""Refrigeration Heat Recovery (RHR) units are utilized to harness waste heat from compressed refrigerants, which redirects part of heat dissipation from condenser to water and serves as a pre-heater. This process effectively reduces energy consumption at water heating, resulting in a 45-55% reduction in corresponding costs, faster milk cooling, and prolonged longevity of the water heater.""",5660,0.4889,ratio
refrig_efficiency_upgrade,high_efficiency_refrigeration,dairy,Efficiency Upgrades and Maintenance,High Efficiency Refrigeration and Scroll Compressors,"""New scroll compressors typically exhibit approximately 15-20% higher efficiency than reciprocating compressors. It is advisable to replace an old compressor with a high-efficiency scroll compressor boasting an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of at least 10. This solution would be economically viable, particularly for farms with compressors aged over a decade or those with high daily milk production levels.""",6210,daily_milk_production_inp*num_1.4,kWh

With VSDs, pumps can operate at optimized speed and thus minimize maintenance costs. For optimal performance, it is recommended to pair VSDs with 3-phase motors.""",10900,operational_hours_inp*num_799.78,kWh
