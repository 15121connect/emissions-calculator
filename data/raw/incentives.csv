TAF partners with a broad range of multi-residential building operators to design, construct and finance major retrofits in the GTHA. Building upgrades include new condensing boilers, heat pumps, LED lighting, smart thermostats, and many more. The program team documents the effects through real-time building performance monitoring and research-grade instrumentation of key equipment and systems. As one of few such demonstration programs in Canada, the most recent TowerWise phase showed that 20-30 percent energy savings are achievable and highly profitable.
